## I want to learn a new (computer) language, But I don't know which one üôÑ

* You need to learn at least five languages by the time you pass out of college. Some really good languages both for competitive programming (mainly for object oriented programming) and web development are: 

	* **Learn C++**: [Here](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/01-introduction-to-these-tutorials/)

	* **Learn how to use STL with C++**: [Here](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/)

	* **Python**: [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

	* **Javascript** [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) is embedding JS into web pages

	* **Java**: [Part 1](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-1/) and [Part 2](http://mooc.fi/courses/2013/programming-part-2/)

	* **Golang**: [Here](https://golang.org/)

	* **Rust**: [Here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) (Mainly for system programming languages and device drivers. Check it out if you're interested and read the documentation.)

  * [The Next Web](https://techcrunch.com/)

  * [The Medium](https://medium.com/topic/technology)

  

## I'd like to read a few books on CS this summer 

* [Here](https://github.com/cs-books/influential-cs-books) is a comprehensive list of cs books that everyone should definitely read.

* Try Reading [CLRS](https://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Algorithms-3e-Thomas-Cormen/dp/0262033844), you can easily get a pdf online.

* These are places where you can get any programming book you will ever need for free !!!
	* [Github repo for free CS books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)
	* [AllItEbooks.in](http://www.allitebooks.in/)


## I'd like to try out some game development üéÆ

* If you like developing Games try out [Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) or [UnReal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4).


## Anything else I can do ?

* Learn how to use APIs (All the Google Applications like Drive, Calendar, Contacts, YouTube are mostly on GitHub).

  * For example, try accessing or downloading your drive files through your command line and try printing your liked videos from YouTube by using their APIs. 

  * You can imagine anything more you want and play around with them which in turn gives motivation.

* Sign up for [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get some sweet goodies (like free private repositories on github).

* Check out [GSOC (Google Summer of Code)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/) and what is it about. Wikipedia link: [Google Summer of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code)
