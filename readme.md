* Install a Linux based OS ([Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop),[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)) on your laptop and learn how to operate Linux based Operating Systems.

* Make it a point that whatever(yes!! literally everything) you do in your computer you do it through command line. Even when it comes to copying, moving or renaming files. Refrain from using file explorers and GUI clients until you really get a firm grip on Linux commands.

* You need to learn at least five languages by the time you pass out of college. Some really good languages both for competitive programming (mainly for object oriented programming) and web development are : 

 * C and C++

 * Python

 * Javascript [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) is embedding JS into web pages

 * Java

 * Golang [here](https://golang.org/)

 * Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) (mainly for system programming languages and device drivers. Check it out if you're interested and read the documentation.)


* Install and Learn how to use GIT from [here](https://git-scm.com/) **(Very Important)**

* Make a Github Account **(Very Important)**
  
* Buy a Raspberry Pi and make a small project with it (list of projects [here](https://circuitdigest.com/simple-raspberry-pi-projects-for-beginners)).

* Buy Arduino and make a small project with it (list of projects [here](https://www.meetup.com/Bend-Arduino-Group/messages/65762292/?_cookie-check=kTIC62wwRBcvcbzE)).

* Learn how to make a website with a FrontEnd Framework (Angular JS, React JS, Vue JS).

* Learn how to make an app with either React Native or Java.

* Learn HTML and CSS.

* Learn C++(http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/01-introduction-to-these-tutorials/)

* Learn how to use STL with C++(https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/)

* Learn about database system like MySQL or MongoDB.

* Learn how to use MongoDB or MySQL and interface it with some language like C++ or JavaScript.

* Learn how servers work

* Implement one GUI based application using python or C++

* Try solving atleast 2 problems a day from CodeChef / HackerRank / HackerEarth

* Explore stuff from [Github Explore](https://github.com/explore)

* Look at [this](https://www.javascriptstuff.com/articles/) blog for more on JS and ReactJS

* Here are some websites where you can find news about upcoming technologies and really awesome stuff

* Learn how to use APIs (All the Google Applications like Drive, Calendar, Contacts, YouTube are mostly on GitHub)

 * For example, try accessing or downloading your drive files through your command line and try printing your liked videos from YouTube by using their APIs. 

 * You can imagine anything more you want and play around with them which in turn gives motivation.
* Install a Linux based OS (Standalone or Dual Boot with Windows) ([Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop),[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)) on your laptop and learn how to operate Linux based Operating Systems.

* Try Learning more about Data Structures and implement them in at least one language
