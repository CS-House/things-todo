# What Should I do in the Summmer ? ü§î

Hi everyone, If you have no clue what you will do after the first 4 exciting days at home, we have come up with a bunch of interesting things you could try out.


## I have no idea what to do üòê

### Start with these things:

* Check out what comes inside Computer Science by watching this video [Map of Computer Science](https://youtu.be/SzJ46YA_RaA).

* Install a Linux based OS ([Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop),[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)) on your laptop and learn how to operate Linux based Operating Systems.

* Make it a point that whatever(yes!! literally everything) you do in your computer you do it through command line. Even when it comes to copying, moving or renaming files. Refrain from using file explorers and GUI clients until you really get a firm grip on Linux commands.

* Install and Learn how to use GIT from [here](https://git-scm.com/) **(Very Important)**

* Make a Github Account **(Very Important)**


## I want to learn a new (computer) language, But I don't know which one üôÑ

* You need to learn at least five languages by the time you pass out of college. Some really good languages both for competitive programming (mainly for object oriented programming) and web development are : 

	* Learn C++(http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/01-introduction-to-these-tutorials/)

	* Learn how to use STL with C++(https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/power-up-c-with-the-standard-template-library-part-1/)


	* Python

	* Javascript [here](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) and [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) is embedding JS into web pages

	* Java

	* Golang [here](https://golang.org/)

	* Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) (mainly for system programming languages and device drivers. Check it out if you're interested and read the documentation.)


## I would like to open doors and windows with my Phone ü§ñ
  
* Buy a Raspberry Pi and make a small project with it (list of projects [here](https://circuitdigest.com/simple-raspberry-pi-projects-for-beginners)).

* Buy Arduino and make a small project with it (list of projects [here](https://www.meetup.com/Bend-Arduino-Group/messages/65762292/?_cookie-check=kTIC62wwRBcvcbzE)).

* Learn about IoT and what it exactly is and how to make something that is IoT enabled.

## I would like to learn how to make a website üë®‚Äçüé®

* Start with [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
It is the best place for starting web development.

* Learn how to make a website with a FrontEnd Framework (Angular JS, React JS, Vue JS).


## I would like to develop a Mobile App üì±

* Learn Kotlin for android app development.

* Learn Swift for iOS app development.

* For Cross platform app development use React Native.


## I would like to know how to store Large amounts of Data üóÑ

* Learn about database system like MySQL or MongoDB.

* Learn how to use MongoDB or MySQL and interface it with some language like C++ or JavaScript.

* Learn how data centers and large data clusters work


## I would like to improve my general logic and coding abilities that will help me in interviews ‚öî

* Try solving atleast 2 problems a day from CodeChef / HackerRank / HackerEarth

* Try Learning more about Data Structures and implement them in at least one language

## I am just generally interested in the exploring the world of CS üî≠

* Explore stuff from [Github Explore](https://github.com/explore)

* Look at [this](https://www.javascriptstuff.com/articles/) blog for more on JS and ReactJS

* Here are some websites where you can find news about upcoming technologies and really awesome stuff

  * [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/)

  * [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io/)

  * [The Well Known TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/)

  * [The Next Web](https://techcrunch.com/)

  * [The Medium](https://medium.com/topic/technology)

  

## I'd like to read a few books on CS this summer 

* [Here](https://github.com/cs-books/influential-cs-books) is a comprehensive list of cs books that everyone should definitely read.

* Try Reading CLRS

* These are places where you can get any programming book you will ever need for free !!!
	* [Github repo for free CS books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md)
	* [AllItEbooks.in](http://www.allitebooks.in/)


## I'd like to try out some game development üéÆ

* If you like developing Games try out [Unity](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) or [UnReal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4) 


## Anything else I can do ?

* Learn how to use APIs (All the Google Applications like Drive, Calendar, Contacts, YouTube are mostly on GitHub)

  * For example, try accessing or downloading your drive files through your command line and try printing your liked videos from YouTube by using their APIs. 

  * You can imagine anything more you want and play around with them which in turn gives motivation.

* Sign up for [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get some sweet goodies (like free private repositories on github).
